      Apply CIS benckmark rule 5.1.5: The default service account should not be used
      to ensure that rights granted to applications can be more easily audited and reviewed.
      Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod,
      and rights granted to that service account. The default service account should be configured such that it does not provide
      a service account token and does not have any explicit rights assignments.
